It involves the observation and analysis of stars, planets, comets, galaxies, and cosmic phenomena outside Earth's atmosphere. Astronomers use telescopes and other instruments to gather data about these objects and phenomena, seeking to understand their origins, evolution, and the laws governing them. Astronomy is one of the oldest sciences and encompasses various subfields, including observational astronomy, theoretical astrophysics, cosmology, and planetary science."
